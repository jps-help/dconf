Welcome to your new module. A short overview of the generated parts can be found
in the [PDK documentation][1].

The README template below provides a starting point with details about what

## Description

This module will install dconf and allow you to manage GNOME desktop environment via Puppet.

## Setup

### What dconf affects **OPTIONAL**

- dconf package
- dconf profiles under `/etc/dconf/profile/`
- dconf db files under `/etc/dconf/db/`

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

See module dependencies for more details.

### Beginning with dconf

For basic use of this module, first make sure the module is installed on your puppet-server, then add the following to your manifest:
```
include dconf
```
This will simply install the dconf packages for your distro. 

## Usage

Include usage examples for common use cases in the **Usage** section. Show your
users how to use your module to solve problems, and be sure to include code
examples. Include three to five examples of the most important or common tasks a
user can accomplish with your module. Show users how to accomplish more complex
tasks that involve different types, classes, and functions working in tandem.

## Reference

This section is deprecated. Instead, add reference information to your code as
Puppet Strings comments, and then use Strings to generate a REFERENCE.md in your
module. For details on how to add code comments and generate documentation with
Strings, see the [Puppet Strings documentation][2] and [style guide][3].

If you aren't ready to use Strings yet, manually create a REFERENCE.md in the
root of your module directory and list out each of your module's classes,
defined types, facts, functions, Puppet tasks, task plans, and resource types
and providers, along with the parameters for each.

For each element (class, defined type, function, and so on), list:

* The data type, if applicable.
* A description of what the element does.
* Valid values, if the data type doesn't make it obvious.
* Default value, if any.

For example:

```
### `pet::cat`

#### Parameters

##### `meow`

Enables vocalization in your cat. Valid options: 'string'.

Default: 'medium-loud'.
```

## Limitations

In the Limitations section, list any incompatibilities, known issues, or other
warnings.

## Development

In the Development section, tell other users the ground rules for contributing
to your project and how they should submit their work.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel are
necessary or important to include here. Please use the `##` header.
